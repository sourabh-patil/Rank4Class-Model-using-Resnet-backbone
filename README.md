# Rank4Class-Model-using-Resnet-backbone
Rank4Class: A Ranking Formulation for Multiclass Classification. I found this paper on arxiv. Link to the paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.09727.pdf
They have visualized the problem of classification throuhgh the lens of ranking. I have used ResNet as backbone which is intergrated with rank4class approach for image classification. This model can be used for any image classification problem. You can modify number of input channels, number of output classes, and specs of the resnet (depth).
